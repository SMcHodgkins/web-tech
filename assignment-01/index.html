      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>In short, I'm a multitool. I can do some art stuff and some editing stuff. I've learned a bit about the adobe suite. Still trying to find the specific focus I want to pursue so a lot of what I'm doing is dabbling and experimenting to see what my preferences are.</p>
      <p> My major is in Media Arts: Digital Technology and expect to graduate next spring</p>

      <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
      <p>I'm willing to explore to find a creative solution. </p>
