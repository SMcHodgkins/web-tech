# Assignment 10

Struggled getting the object to appear in the canvas because I didn't make a function in the class initially for it. Probably because I forgot about a bunch of class related things.

Having issues with the collision. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be checking for.

I tried to call the function whenever square1 would move but I would get a "y is undefined error".

I moved where I called the function around a bit but still couldn't get it to work. Maybe this is a problem with my getters and settters?

Turning in something is better than nothing, maybe I'll revise it later.
