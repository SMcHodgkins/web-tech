# Assignment 1
---
This was a bit of a rocky road on remembering everything that I learned about html and css in the previous classes. I found myself looking up several things as I progressed, but it started coming back to me pretty quickly. It feels like this is a "use it or lose it" type skill and if I want to actually do this in the future I should focus on keeping my skills active. I found myself struggling with defining who I am/what I can do because honestly I don't think I can do much, not yet at least.

Hopefully that changes with time.

I honestly think I'm going to remake it as a portfolio. That would make more sense for me.
