I'm starting to wonder if there's an easier way to update the dropdown menu on each of my pages with one click rather than manually inputting a new link on each of them.

I'm having trouble getting two columns to sit next to each other using css.

I accidentally set my flip function to the wrong array.

My createImages function is dying on anything above 4.
  Because I didn't set enough values in the array tracking the random number.
