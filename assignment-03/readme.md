I couldn't figure out why my "window()" function wouldn't function. Turns out window is already a function. Fantastic.

I had an issue where I attempted to change the id of an element using js and then immediately attempt to change the html. Instead I just changed the html and then changed the id and that worked.

I chose a branching story and that was a mistake, but at least I could re-use a bunch of the code.
